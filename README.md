  * Human Anatomy & Physiology Laboratory Manual: Making Connections distinguishes itself from other A&P lab manuals by focusing on and addressing the most common teaching challenges in the lab–getting students to engage in the lab, to prepare for the lab, and to apply concepts in the lab. Catharine Whiting’s active learning approach incorporates a rich variety of hands-on activities and guided questions to get students engaged and asking questions. The 2nd Edition provides new features, such as “What You Need to Know Before You Start this Unit” at the beginning of each Unit and new Pre-Lab Video Coaching Activities to help students learn what they need to review before lab.
